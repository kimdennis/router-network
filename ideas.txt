How to store the graph?
- create a class for the graph

global var:
- nx_graph: the graph

functions of RouterNetwork class:
- buildNetwork(): reads data.txt to create a graph with nx_graph
- renderNetwork(): renders nx_graph and updates network.html file

How to format edges and nodes?
- use a txt file (i.e. data.txt)
	- format: 
		OPTION 1
		n (number of nodes)
		node1
		node2
		...
		nodex
		e (number of edges)
		start1 end1 weight1
		start2 end2 weight2
		...
		startx endx weightx
		
		OPTION 2??
		node1 node2 node3 ... nodex
		start1 end1 weight1 start2 end2 weight2 ... startx endx weightx

		OPTION 3**
		node1 node2 node3 ... nodex
		start1 start2 ... startx
		end1 end2 ... endx
		weight1 weight2 ... weightx

		In python:
		- splice each line 
		- use python's zip function on the start, end and weight values, this will create an
		  iterable we can use to add edges to the graph later
		- use networkx's add_nodes_from(iterable) and add_edge() with weight and label attributes
		  to create the graph
		
		OPTION 4**
		create a weighted adjacency matrix
